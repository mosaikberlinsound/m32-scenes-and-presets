Hey there! This page is your one-stop information for the Tech Visual ministry.

## Team name
The official name of the team is *Tech Visual Team*, though you may still hear the legacy name *Beamer Team* being used to refer to everything displays related occassionally.
## Accounts and team communications

Each volunteer in this ministry is assigned a Mosaik email address and a Church Tools account. The purpose of the new email address is to ease the procedure in resetting Church Tools password if one happens to forget their password. Below are the relevant accounts and what they are for:

- Church Tools 
→ Rota scheduling, event rundown, and as a general church database
- Seafile Cloud (or simply Cloud) 
→ where we grab the sermon slides, announcement designs, and videos

Considering it can be a hassle for volunteers to have yet another inbox to check, all communications will be done in the WhatsApp group. Please contact [beamer@mosaikberlin.com](mailto:beamer@mosaikberlin.com) if you are not on WhatsApp.

## Monitoring station

### Desk and computer

Currently, we have a portable cabinet which can serve as a workstation as well. To set it up as a workstation, simply take off the door from its hinges and do the following:

1. Fold out the desk leg, which can be found inside the door
2. Latch the other end, opposite to the leg hinges, to the left side of the drawers

Once the desk is setup, the church computer can be setup on top of it. The computer will use the same power source as for the audio team. The computer (mac mini 🍎), bluetooth keyboard, mouse, and all cables are stored in the 1st and 2nd drawers of the workstation:

![](/images/7c87bc4ba3bcb89007cbba6716da64fbbbb57d0e376b928a4b67554390926223.jpeg)

The login credentials for the computer and WiFi are:

- PC: `MosaikBerlin`
- Heeresbäckerei WLAN: `Magazin`

The first thing to do once the computer starts up is to **sync the local Seafile folders**. This makes sure the local copies of documents and playlists for ProPresenter are up-to-date. The cloud icon should turn green once the sync is finished.

![](/images/ebee5478f74ef4fa7b0026decb01c568b7f4c483664bdd87ed00979519d2ace9.jpeg)

⚠️  While the picture above shows an individual email account, please make sure it is the `media@mosaikberlin.com` that is logged in. **If this is not the case, please reach out in the WhatsApp group!** It may be complicated to get all volunteers access to multiple central folders. Therefore, we just use `media@mosaikberlin.com` account.

While Seafile is syncing, you can download the sermon notes and announcements for that Sunday. These can be found in https://cloud.mosaikberlin.com/library/ca8a3219-1c3a-4806-be06-556dfc171e49/Media/Designs/01_Predigtserien/2021/Fertige%20Slides under the folder named after that Sunday's date. Note that you need to login with **your individual** Seafile account to access that folder.

If the main window happens to not be displayed, you can show it by doing a left-click on this menu on the toolbar

![](/images/6a7e764dfe90ba8d5103fc9059d94b792182a233d9c2cb66988002f6be94d2f1.jpeg)

### TV, Wireless HDMI, and audio output

Since the TV screens are huge, please ask for help from the people serving that Sunday with mounting and unmounting the screens to the TV stands. The TV screens can be found in the TV case. **All** the necessary cables are normally stored in the second drawer of the cabinet, together with the Mac mini 🍎

Once the TV screens are mounted, power the TV and the wireless HDMI, and plug in the HDMI cable from the HDMI receiver to HDMI channel 1 of the TV. The connections are pretty much similar to the picture below

![](/images/e2fe4d9b85cc9d0f5516890b8239f9d32f32a45b2dfbb313bcf4a591fdc6b9fd.jpeg)

Also, make sure that the TV uses HDMI 1 as the input source.

![](/images/3e37ea9fb28b1e494b1aada21d8739c812d233bd1ed112a3fb27578a487b5324.jpeg)

The HDMI transmitter box is powered via the orange USB cable. Simply plug in the power cable to a USB port of the Mac mini, screw in the two antennas, and plug in the HDMI cable to the Mac mini. Here are some pictures how they are plugged in:

![](/images/1702d5ce8c93aceed9d4b9d3675e175b29255ec7a071569876050da7819d2574.jpeg)
![](/images/71ae32b5e06967cde9bbfa32f565fc726dc59f110b9008112c8d66c0656778c6.jpeg)

**Important☝🏼: For the power cable of the external monitor, make sure that it is all the way in**

Audio coming from the computer (e.g., for the countdown video) is controlled by the audio engineer serving that Sunday. To set that up, plug in the cable from the sound board to the audio jack of the Mac mini 🍎, which is below the USB ports.

**Please coordinate with the audio engineer serving that Sunday for testing the computer audio before the service starts
**
### Teardown

After the service, please make sure you check off the items in the list below:

- [ ]  Sync ProPresenter with Seafile (refer to the **Pre-service preparation** section)
- [ ]  Sync Seafile on the computer to cloud
- [ ]  Exit all programs
- [ ]  Turn off the Mac mini 🍎
- [ ]  Unplug all cables at the workstation
- [ ]  Unplug all cables behind the TV screens

![](/images/b08053dbf841e5f5519c069a8e21f04b450289198607766d396f4e2513c94d97.jpeg)
> ☝🏼 ⌘ + Space and type "shut down" and hit Enter to safely turn off mac mini 🍎
> 


> **Important:** During teardown, please remind the people that help unmounting the TV that we should not store the cables in the TV case. They are forgotten all the time, and it's annoying having to have two people every time to lift the lid of the TV case just to grab the cables in there
>

- [ ]  Store all cables (TV and monitoring station) and the wireless HDMI transmitter in the second drawer in the cabinet as they fit
- [ ]  Store the Mac mini 🍎 in the first drawer
- [ ]  Store all cables, bluetooth keyboard, and mouse in the second drawer
- [ ]  Store the external monitor at the padded top storage of the cabinet
- [ ]  Coordinate with the Aufbau/Abbau team on moving the cabinet, and the TV case into the storage room

## ProPresenter

> **Important:** Only start ProPresenter after the wireless HDMI connection is successful. The desktop background of the PC should be displayed on the TV when the connection is successful.
> 

### Pre-service preparation
> ☝🏼  If ProPresenter fires a bunch of error windows on startup, **don't panic**. ProPresenter is just naggy and loud like that.

![](/images/24b7429129c8fdf31a2b885d9c548c11a0892a7289d14d6d7a6087ffb433f965.jpeg)

If you get a sync error message similar to the screenshot above, click Revert.

Since we have a *klein (aber fein!)* stage, we only need to prepare one playlist. Before everything else, sync all media by going to ***ProPresenter 6 > Preferences*** or use the keyboard shortcut `⌘-, [⌘-Comma]`. Then open the ***Sync*** tab, make sure ***Bidirectional sync*** is selected, and hit the ***Sync*** button. Please note that the `Source` path will be different than what is shown in the picture below. Close the window once the sync is finished.

![](/images/a8b71f9d309247b5d4ce9e48cb4aaf393a18e5cfe82abfc0b08f9423acbb90fb.jpeg)

On the bottom left, you should see a playlist named `Gottesdienst`. If it's not there, click the **+** button on the bottom left corner, create a new playlist, and name it `Gottesdienst`.

![](/images/f790cea09c8550c6a6e8c4cf91e00999022b606be074cdc01e1ce385c04efc83.jpeg)

In this playlist, there should be 2 headers: one for the German service, one for the English service. If they are not there, create these headers by selecting the playlist, then click the **+** button, and select ***New Header***.

Under each headers are what we call ***Documents***. We basically have the following types of documents:

- Welcome <DE | EN>
- Announcements <DE | EN>
- Predigt <DE | EN>
- Lyrics slides

If they are not there, simply look it up in the ***Library*** panel by entering the name on the search bar (e.g., `Announcements DE`), drag the document from ***Library*** and drop it to below the corresponding header. Next, make sure the correct songs have been added to the playlist. Please refer to Church Tools for the list and the order of the songs for that Sunday.

![](/images/14fb2e34c11b49379a4333a734bbe510ee362f8ca7313a0fa296089f75a0b3ff.jpeg)

Update the ***Welcome***, ***Announcements***, and ***Predigt*** documents with the slides from Seafile. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Download `Announcements` and `Predigt Slides` folders from Seafile
2. Unzip each folder, and copy the contents from `Downloads` folder into the correct folders under `Desktop/Sunday/DE` for the German service, or `Desktop/Sunday/EN` for the English service
3. In the ***Video/Image*** panel, select `DE` for the German service, or `EN` for the English service
4. The *"Hot Folders"* (orange icon) under each group should be automatically synced with the folders on `Desktop/Sunday` and the files copied should show up in ProPresenter
5. Select one or more files, and drag-and-drop it to the slides preview area on the center of the screen, under the name of the document it belongs to. For example, if the slide is an announcement slide and is in German, scroll the slides preview area until you see `Announcements DE` and place the new file under that document name.

![](/images/PPDragNDropFiles.gif)

6. For the predigt slides, the file import for some reason messes the order of the slides. Please reorder them based on the number **at the end of the file name** (the first number is a number assigned by ProPresenter)

> Pro Tip #1: To select all files in the folder, click any file and  press `⌘ + a`
> 

&nbsp;

> Pro Tip #2: Don't bother sorting the predigt slides within the ***Video/Image*** panel. It's much easier to sort the slides in the slides preview area
>

### Song lyrics slides

Most songs are already saved in the ***Library*** and can be looked up by typing the song's name in the Library search bar. If they are not in our Library, see section **Adding lyrics slides into the Library** or let the team know via WhatsApp.

> **Note ☝  : Unlike PowerPoint, ProPresenter allows us to not have the slides in order. We can simply click on the right lyric slide to show as we can see the grid on the workstation monitor.**

To add the songs into the `Gottesdienst` playlist, drag the song from the ***Library*** panel and drop it to below the correct header in ***Playlist*** panel. Reorder the documents according to the Agenda on ChurchTools. The final playlist should look something like this:

![](/images/fcd7792d1c2b764b5eb3380b57a1d7ba5c1508740fb1534d2c9e7e7e6561bba7.jpeg)

And the slides preview area should look similar to this:

![](/images/7d7e90d85e4eac7d933ebd485a068a992e0b8497cc3397de117e5cacf615a9cb.jpeg)

> Note: if the slides preview area only displays one document, click the ***Contiguous*** button on the top of the ***Playlist*** panel
> 

#### Translated song lyrics

Since our congregation is bilingual, we usually display the German translations to English songs in the German service. Sometimes, we display the English translation to songs played in German. These lyrics slides have `(Ü)` appended to their document names (for *Übersetzung*). As a rule of thumb, the main language is the language the title of the document is in. If the title is English, then it is a song in German, translated into English, and vice versa.

### Adding and editing lyrics slides in Library

Sometimes, we may not have the song to be played for that Sunday in the Library yet, or we need to add translations coming from Dave. In those cases, we need to add or edit the lyrics slides.

#### Adding lyrics slides

To add a song from SongSelect into our Library, type the song title in the Library search bar, and click on the song title. A pop-up should be displayed as shown in the screenshot below. Click on the plus button on the upper right corner of that pop-up.

![](/images/52498e37485a3e37124967a2c5db2f724549ed893c095d653889191619cabf53.jpeg)

> Please contact the team on WhatsApp if the results from SongSelect is not showing in the ***Library*** panel
> 

A new window should be displayed. Set the dropdown values to the values shown in the screenshot below.

![](/images/c01a423e576d355a7b5b92d0f0f213daae50bcb019db92cac9e230cc50494672.jpeg)

Click ***Import***. 

#### Editing lyrics slides

Sometimes the lyrics from SongSelect include cue words such as *(REPEAT)* or *(2x)*. We need to make sure that these are removed before the service. To do so, click on the document with the song title in ***Library*** panel. This should display the slides in the slide preview area. Right click on a slide in the preview area and select ***Edit Slide***.

![](/images/a601510f588539d78489e0cf6f5295a054b0caa80da5d6e028535896d6322dcd.jpeg)

In the Slide Editor, click the slide to edit, and double click the text area. Do `Shift + Arrow key` to find your text cursor. Make edits as necessary. ProPresenter, admittedly, does not have a nice UX for slide editing, but bear with me. A way to preview your edits is by clicking the ***Show*** button above the ***Video/Image*** panel. If you don't want your edits to be displayed on the TV screens, turn the ***Output*** off (see **Displaying slides during the service** section).

![](/images/b0a16f14d6946b93c5b9f9c1b904d75345229cba978f79ab4413fef58c076a04.jpeg)

Save your changes by clicking the `X` button above the first slide.

#### Adding translations to the lyrics slides

> Note: These are the steps that work for me. Suggestions on an easier way to do this is always welcomed!
> 

![](/images/8d82711354337cb50ecad435109c2f8d4d03a16a267a60dcee388d3141acd44d.jpeg)

To add translations, follow these steps:

1. Select the last slide and do `⌘ + C` to copy
2. Hit `⌘ + V` to paste
3. Edit the text to be the translations for the first slide (Tips: right click and select *Paste and Match Style* so that the text is pasted following the style of the slide template)
4. Right click on the new slide, select *Template > Mosaik Berlin > lyrics bilingual second*
5. Right click on the first slide, select *Template > Mosaik Berlin > lyrics bilingual main*
6. Click the new slide, select the text area, hit `⌘ + C` to copy
7. Go to the first slide, click the slide (but *do not* select the text) and hit `⌘ + V` to paste
8. Press and hold the `arrow down` button until the translation text is placed nicely below the main lyrics. Adjust with the arrow buttons as necessary.
9. Now you can reuse this new slide to repeat step 4-8 to edit the rest of the lyrics slides
10. Once you're done appending the translations, right click on the temp slide and select *Delete*
11. Save your changes by clicking the `X` button above the first slide.
12. **Important:** Make sure the document name is appended with `(Ü)`. This will make searching for lyrics slides for the others easier.

### Displaying slides during the service

To display a slide on the TV screen, first turn on the ***Output*** by clicking the ***Ouput*** button on the upper right corner.

![](/images/73b4a4e614621e9e8b406a32c430c636be655e43f0e939ad2d5165b7dffcb13e.jpeg)

As you can see on the left side above the ***Library*** panel, you can also see what is fed into the output on that small preview panel. Switching slides is as simple as clicking the slide to be displayed and for this reason, the Welcome, Announcements, and the song lyrics (within each document) do not need to strictly be in order. 

### Keyboard shortcuts

As an alternative to mouse clicks, the following keyboard shortcuts may also be helpful:


| Command | macOS Shortcut |
| :--------: | :--------: |
| Move file to trash  | ⌘ + Backspace |
| Quit ProPresenter  | ⌘ + Q |
| Select all items  | ⌘ + A |
| Next slide | Right arrow  |
| Previous Slide | Left arrow |
| Clear all | F1 |
| Toggle Output Screens On/Off | ⌘ + 1 |
| Jump to slide number | slide number + Enter |


### Troubleshooting
#### Incorrect output size

Go to ***ProPresenter 6 > Preferences*** or use the keyboard shortcut `⌘-, [⌘-Comma]`, and click on the tab ***Display**.* Enable the option ***Scale to Fit Output Display*** and check one of the TV screen if that fixes the output size.

![](/images/928494d1c8cdf3090f6664520bbad839befd957504cf40bba4d55166a04753fe.jpeg)

#### ProPresenter audio is not recognized by the sound board

This typically happens when ProPresenter has been opened before the audio jack is plugged into the mac mini 🍎. Simply restart ProPresenter after plugging in the audio jack when this happens. ProPresenter does not automatically detect a *new* audio output device, and thus needs "a little push" to detect the sound board.

#### Black monitor screen

If the screen turns blank after starting up ProPresenter, it could be that ProPresenter might still think that the PC's display is the output display. This is why it's important to make sure the HDMI connection is successful first before starting ProPresenter. To solve this issue, try moving the mouse cursor to the bottom left of the monitor. An `X` button might show up, which means ProPresenter has assumed that the monitor is the output screen. Reset the display setting to the following snapshot:
